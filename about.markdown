I am a hobbyist programmer from Germany with a tendency to get stuck in overly
ambitious projects which I can never finish.

My main project is currently [asternix](https://github.com/Wunst/asternix), a
toy OS / Unix clone for x86. You can type text in it (kinda)!

Also expect random bursts of game dev (even though I haven't developed anything
mature enough that I would like to share it) and long periods of inactivityâ„¢.
